### Course Overview

Technological advances, and the uses we make of them, continue to radically reshape the world we live in. Data is being collected and analyzed on an unprecedented scale; algorithms play an ever-increasing role in the decisions we make; social media is cited as radically transforming both personal and political discourse; and the list goes on. These developments raise a host of pressing ethical questions that we need to confront, both as a society, and as individuals. The aim of this class is to introduce students to some of these questions and equip them with the conceptual tools needed to engage with them productively and responsibly. Issues studied include:

- Privacy
- Consent to data practices
- Algorithmic justice
- Online manipulation and “dark patterns”
- Echo chambers
- Censorship and freedom of speech

In addition to looking at technology ethics, this class is intended as an introduction to moral philosophy and does not presuppose any philosophical background.
